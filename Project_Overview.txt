This is an overview of the project as the project write up has a lot of information

Concept:

You are tasked with creating a voting system that is capable of performing the following two types of voting:
1) Instant Runoff Voting (plurality/majority type) - vote for canditaes in order of candidates. 
If your first choice candidate does not have enough votes, the candidate is kicked off, and the second choice candidate is taken into account 

2) Party List Voting using Closed Party List (proportional voting type) - vote for one party (not specific candidate). The number of votes determines
the number of seats per party, and a preorder list determines which candidate gets the seats

Type of development process: Waterfall

First step of process: Create software requirements specification (SRS) document
